📚 Student Activity Manager (React)

The Student Activity Manager is a simple and interactive React application that helps manage student records.
It is designed to practice core React concepts such as state, props, conditional rendering, event handling, and component communication.

This project allows users to add students, view details, mark active/inactive status, and delete records — all handled on the frontend without any backend or database.
