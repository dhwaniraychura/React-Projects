📌 Project Title

Employee Management System (React.js)

📝 Project Description

The Employee Management System is a modern, single-page web application developed using React.js that allows users to manage employee records efficiently. The application provides functionality to add, view, edit, and delete employees, with all data stored locally using browser LocalStorage.

The project follows a component-based architecture and uses React Hooks (useState, useEffect) for state management. Navigation between pages is handled using React Router DOM, ensuring a smooth user experience without page reloads.

A visually appealing and responsive user interface is created using Bootstrap along with custom CSS, featuring a modern pink-purple glassmorphism theme. The employee data is displayed in a transparent, grid-styled table with clear row and column separation for better readability.

Each employee record includes details such as Employee ID, Name, Email, Phone Number, Department, Designation, Salary, Status (Active/Inactive), and Profile Image. The status is visually represented using color-coded badges for better clarity.

This project demonstrates practical usage of CRUD operations, form handling, file upload handling (image preview using FileReader), and local data persistence, making it suitable for learning and showcasing real-world React application development.
